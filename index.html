      Welcome to Visual Artist in Tech!

        To access all page content, please open the "Developer 
        Tools" of your browser and enter the "Console". If you 
        haven't done this before just check out "STEP 01" 
        below, no experience needed!

        The interface of this website is specifically designed
        for artists not yet confident in their ability to sustain 
        and enrich their studio practices through employment as 
        software engineers and web developers.

        Anyone who can make art can learn to program. Believe
        nothing to the contrary. By locating and reading these 
        sentences you have already taken the first and 
        most significant step.



      STEP 01 - Open Your Browser's "Console"

        For Google Chrome users locate the "View" dropdown menu
        at the top of your screen and select "Developer" and then
        "JavaScript Console".

        For Firefox users locate the "Tools" dropdown menu
        at the top of your screen and select "Web Developer" and then
        "Web Console".
